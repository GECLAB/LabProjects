# Project Overview
This project aims to assess and project post-fire transitions and reburn dynamics in the western Cascades using the LANDIS-II landscape vegetation simulation model. It will evaluate how forest ecosystems respond to future climate changes and emerging land management strategies.

# Objectives
Synthesize existing research on post-fire and post-reburn forest development.
Use LANDIS-II to project forest ecosystem responses to climate change and fire regimes.

# Geographic Scope
The research covers the western Cascades, spanning parts of Washington and Oregon.

This repository contains the following folders:

# LANDIS Inputs

These are the primary inputs for running the LANDIS-II model.  LANDIS inputs include both maps and text files, dependent upon the extensions selected.

# LANDIS Installers

The version of each LANDIS extension used for forecasting forest change.

Extensions included:

- Extension Biomass BDA: Insect mortality (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Biomass-BDA)
- Extension NECN Succession: Succession and Carbon dynamics (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-NECN-Succession)
- Extension SCRPPLE: Fire mortality (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-SCRPPLE)
- Extension Biomass Harvest: Harvest management (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Biomass-Harvest)
- Extension Output Biomass: Species biomass (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Output-Biomass)
- Extension Output Biomass Community: Produces list of all cohorts (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Output-Biomass-Community)
- Extension Output Age Reclass: Produces map outpus by species-age classes (https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Output-Age-Reclassification)

# Scripts

Contains R scripts that were used to derive inputs and to analyze LANDIS-II model outputs.
